# good-readme-generator

## Description
This is a README generator for developers.  A README is an important part of any project, and this generator helps to streamline the creation process. This was one of the easier assignments, I felt like I had a pretty good grasp on what I needed to do to complete this.  I utilized a lot of what we had learned with the mini project and Units 9/10 at large to make this come together.  That being said, I did ask BCS once for clarification on proper logic syntax to use.  

## Contributors
I wrote all of the code, but also received help from my instructor John, and utilized the BCS Tutors for help with some logic syntax.

In addition, the code for the License badges can be found in this public repository from Github user lukas-h.  https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba 

## Testing
